### Registration[LogIn / SignUp]
* Part I:

	[Just like customer registration process, winch drivers register by their mobile number, to do a verification step on this mobile number and to check whether there is an account associated with this mobile number, to let him login to this account or if there is no account associated with this number, to let this winch driver complete his registration process by entering his first and last name or continue with his social accounts.](https://github.com/sherif17/customer_app#Registration)
  
* Part II :

  If it is the first time winch driver register in the app, winch driver is required to enter winch plates information and upload important files, to be reviewed by admin to decide whether to accept this winch driver or not.

#### Note: Currently for testing,we skip the part of reviewing of the admins for uploaded information, Winch driver will be approved directly if he uploaded all the required information. 
    
* Home & Profile page.

  After registration, Winch driver will be able to use our app normally,recieving incoming requests and viewing associated information to this account.
